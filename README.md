# CodeWars
A very simple server - client appplication for the preliminary round of a quiz event.

Coded using basic java, javascript, JSTL, HTML and CSS; this application fetches a set of questions from a database, randomises and displays them.

A timer is included that automatically hits the submit button after the specified time.
The submit button, calculates the total marks and inserts the result along with the requested details again in a database.
